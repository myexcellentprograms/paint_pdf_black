This program aims to paint some text of a pdf black, so that anyone wishing to memorize the pdf's content can have some promts while memorizing it.

Steps to use this program:
1. open 1\dist\this.exe
2. input file path as said on the terminal
3. wait (I have yet to implement a progress bar)
4. your image is in 1\dist
